  <h1>
  ONDEWO SIP Client Java Library
  </h1>
</div>

This library gives a Java application a typed, ready-to-use gRPC client for the ONDEWO
SIP (SIP Telephony) server.

It contains no hand-written protocol code. The service and message classes are generated from
the protobuf definitions in the [ondewo-sip-api](https://github.com/ondewo/ondewo-sip-api) repository
(vendored here as a git submodule) by the
[ONDEWO proto compiler](https://github.com/ondewo/ondewo-proto-compiler) (vendored as a second
submodule), which also renders the `pom.xml` and packages the jar. Everything under
`src/main/java` and the `pom.xml` are therefore build output that happens to be committed, so
the repository can be consumed and opened in an IDE without Docker.

## Requirements

| For | You need |
| --- | --- |
| Using the library | JDK 11 or newer (the jar is compiled with `maven.compiler.release=11`) |
| Building the jar locally | JDK 11+ and Maven 3.6+ |
| Regenerating the stubs | Docker, GNU Make, git |

## Installation

### Maven Central

The published coordinates are `com.ondewo:ondewo-sip-client-java`. Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.ondewo</groupId>
  <artifactId>ondewo-sip-client-java</artifactId>
  <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:

```groovy
dependencies { implementation 'com.ondewo:ondewo-sip-client-java:VERSION' }
```

No `<repositories>` block is needed - Maven Central is the default repository of both build
tools. Every published version ships the binary jar, a sources jar and a javadoc jar, each with
a detached PGP signature, so an IDE resolves sources and docs automatically.

> Which versions are on Maven Central is listed at
> [search.maven.org](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.ondewo/ondewo-sip-client-java).
> Versions released before the namespace was verified are only available through the two
> fallbacks below.

### JitPack

[JitPack](https://jitpack.io) builds this repository straight from its git tag, so it works for
every tag, including ones that predate the Maven Central release:

```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>jitpack.io</id>
    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.ondewo</groupId>
  <artifactId>ondewo-sip-client-java</artifactId>
  <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:

```groovy
repositories { maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } }
dependencies { implementation 'com.github.ondewo:ondewo-sip-client-java:VERSION' }
```

### Jar from the GitHub release

Every [release](https://github.com/ondewo/ondewo-sip-client-java/releases) carries the built
`ondewo-sip-client-java-<version>.jar` and its sources jar as assets. Install one into
your local repository with the `pom.xml` of the matching tag, so the transitive gRPC and
protobuf dependencies come along:

```bash
mvn install:install-file \
  -Dfile=ondewo-sip-client-java-<version>.jar \
  -DpomFile=pom.xml
```

It is then available as:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.ondewo</groupId>
  <artifactId>ondewo-sip-client-java</artifactId>
  <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

### From source

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ondewo/ondewo-sip-client-java.git
cd ondewo-sip-client-java
make package        # compiles the committed stubs into target/*.jar
```

## Usage

The generated classes keep the java package protoc derives from the proto package, so the
service stubs of this client live in `ondewo.sip`. Each proto service `Foo` becomes a
`FooGrpc` class with a blocking, a future and an async stub; list what is available with:

```bash
ls src/main/java/ondewo/sip/*Grpc.java
```

A minimal call, with the bearer token ONDEWO servers expect attached to every request:

```java
import com.ondewo.sip.auth.BearerToken;
import com.ondewo.sip.channel.ClientConfig;
import com.ondewo.sip.channel.GrpcChannels;
import io.grpc.ManagedChannel;
import ondewo.sip.SipGrpc;

String host = System.getenv("ONDEWO_HOST");
int port = Integer.parseInt(System.getenv("ONDEWO_PORT"));
String accessToken = System.getenv("ONDEWO_TOKEN");

// TLS against the JVM trust store; a custom CA, mutual TLS and plaintext are described in
// "TLS, mutual TLS and certificates" below.
ManagedChannel channel = GrpcChannels.newChannel(
    ClientConfig.builder().host(host).port(port).build());

SipGrpc.SipBlockingStub stub = new BearerToken(accessToken)
    .attachTo(SipGrpc.newBlockingStub(channel));

// ... issue requests through `stub`, then shut the channel down:
channel.shutdownNow();
```

`BearerToken` is a hand-written class of this client, like the `channel` package below (see
[Hand-written code beside the stubs](#hand-written-code-beside-the-stubs)); it wraps the
`authorization: Bearer <token>` header every ONDEWO server expects. Attaching the header by hand
with `MetadataUtils.newAttachHeadersInterceptor(...)` works just as well.

Note that the protos do not set `java_multiple_files`, so every message is nested inside
the outer class protoc names after the proto file: `ondewo/sip/sip.proto` →
`ondewo.sip.SipOuterClass` (protoc appends `OuterClass` because the file also declares a
service named `Sip`). No `com.ondewo.sip` classes are generated, which is why the
hand-written `BearerToken` can live there without ever colliding with the generator.

## TLS, mutual TLS and certificates

`com.ondewo.sip.channel` opens the channel for you: `ClientConfig` holds where to connect and
the certificate material, `GrpcChannels` turns it into a `ManagedChannel` (or a
`ManagedChannelBuilder` to add your own settings). Both are hand-written and live outside the
generated packages, so a regeneration keeps them.

| Mode                           | `useSecureChannel` | Config fields                                                                  |
|--------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Plaintext (not for production) | `false`            | none                                                                           |
| TLS, JVM trust store           | `true` (default)   | none                                                                           |
| TLS, custom CA                 | `true` (default)   | `grpcCert` = PEM of the CA that signed the server certificate                  |
| Mutual TLS                     | `true` (default)   | `grpcClientCert` and `grpcClientKey`, plus `grpcCert` unless the JVM trusts the server |

Rules the code enforces:

* The three fields hold **PEM content**, **not file paths**. Read the files yourself
  (`Files.readString(Path.of(...))`). Something that is not PEM - typically a path - makes
  `GrpcChannels` throw `IllegalArgumentException` before any connection is attempted.
* `grpcClientCert` and `grpcClientKey` go together: setting only one makes
  `ClientConfig.Builder.build()` throw `IllegalArgumentException`. Neither set (or both empty)
  means plain server-authenticated TLS.
* `useSecureChannel(false)` with a client identity throws `IllegalArgumentException` instead of
  silently dropping the identity. A plaintext channel logs a `WARNING` naming `host:port`
  through the `java.util.logging` logger `com.ondewo.sip.channel.GrpcChannels`; the library never
  touches your logging configuration.
* No error message and no `toString()` renders a PEM or the key (see the security notes below).
* `grpcClientKey` must be an **unencrypted PKCS#8** PEM, which is what `openssl req -newkey ... -nodes`
  (OpenSSL 3) writes. Convert a traditional EC / RSA key with
  `openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in old.key -out client.key`.
* The server certificate is verified against `grpcCert` (the JVM's default trust store when it is
  empty), and the host you connect to must match one of the certificate's subject alternative
  names (SAN). When you connect by an IP the certificate does not list, name the host to check
  with `overrideAuthority(...)` on the builder.
* A bare IPv6 literal host is bracketed for you (`::1` → `[::1]:50051`).

```java
import com.ondewo.sip.channel.ClientConfig;
import com.ondewo.sip.channel.GrpcChannels;
import io.grpc.ManagedChannel;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;

ClientConfig config = ClientConfig.builder()
    .host("10.0.0.5")
    .port(50051)
    .grpcCert(Files.readString(Path.of("certs/ca.pem")))
    .grpcClientCert(Files.readString(Path.of("certs/client.pem")))   // leave both out for
    .grpcClientKey(Files.readString(Path.of("certs/client.key")))    // server-authenticated TLS
    .build();

ManagedChannel channel = GrpcChannels.newChannelBuilder(config)
    .overrideAuthority("sip.example.internal")   // only when connecting by an IP the SAN lacks
    .build();
```

`GrpcChannels.newChannel(config)` is the short form without extra settings. One channel serves
every stub of every service of this client: build it once, share it, and shut it down at the end.

### Channel defaults

`GrpcChannels` applies the channel options of the ONDEWO Python clients where grpc-java exposes
them, and documents where it cannot:

| Python client (grpc-core)                                         | Java client (grpc-java)                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `keepalive_time_ms=30000`                                         | `keepAliveTime` **5 minutes** - see below                          |
| `keepalive_timeout_ms=20000`, `http2.ping_timeout_ms=20000`       | `keepAliveTimeout` 20 s: how long grpc-java waits for the ping ack |
| `keepalive_permit_without_calls=0`                                | `keepAliveWithoutCalls(false)`                                     |
| `http2.max_pings_without_data=2`                                  | not available in grpc-java                                         |
| `max_reconnect_backoff_ms=5000`                                   | not available in grpc-java's public API (its default backoff caps at 120 s) |
| max receive / send message length `2^31-1`                        | `maxInboundMessageSize(Integer.MAX_VALUE)`; grpc-java has no send limit |
| retry policy for idempotent methods                               | none configured: only gRPC's transparent retries                   |

Why 5 minutes and not 30 seconds: the Python clients stop pinging after two pings without data
(`http2.max_pings_without_data=2`), and grpc-java has no such limit. A grpc-java client pinging
every 30 s keeps pinging a stream on which nothing is sent, and a default grpc-core server (every
ONDEWO Python server) answers the third such ping with a `too_many_pings` GOAWAY - measured
against a grpcio 1.81 server: a server stream silent for 170 s failed with
`UNAVAILABLE: Too many pings` after 150 s at 30 s, and one silent for 640 s completed at 5 minutes.
Five minutes is the ping rate a default grpc-core or grpc-go server accepts without data, so the
keepalive still detects a dead connection under an active call without ever tearing down a
healthy one. A server that permits faster pings can be paired with a shorter `keepAliveTime` on
the builder.

### A test PKI with openssl

A CA, a server certificate with SANs, and a client certificate with the `clientAuth` extended key
usage. For tests only: the keys are unencrypted.

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey ec -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:prime256v1 -nodes -days 365 \
  -subj "/CN=Test CA" -keyout ca.key -out ca.pem

printf 'subjectAltName=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth\n' > server.ext
openssl req -newkey ec -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:prime256v1 -nodes \
  -subj "/CN=localhost" -keyout server.key -out server.csr
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -days 365 \
  -extfile server.ext -out server.pem

printf 'extendedKeyUsage=clientAuth\n' > client.ext
openssl req -newkey ec -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:prime256v1 -nodes \
  -subj "/CN=my-client" -keyout client.key -out client.csr
openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -days 365 \
  -extfile client.ext -out client.pem

chmod 600 *.key
openssl verify -CAfile ca.pem server.pem client.pem
```

The client then uses `ca.pem` / `client.pem` / `client.key`; a server that requires client
certificates uses `server.pem` / `server.key` and trusts `ca.pem` for its clients. The test suite
builds the same PKI in memory at test time (`TestPki`), so no key is ever committed.

### TLS security notes

* `ClientConfig.toString()` shows `grpcClientKey` as `***REDACTED***` (empty when unset) and the
  certificates only as their length, so logging a config never leaks the key.
  `getGrpcClientKey()` returns the key in clear text: never log it.
* `ClientConfig` has no serialized form. Keep the key out of configuration files and source
  control; load it from a file with mode `0600` or a secret store at startup.
* `BearerToken` keeps the access token in memory only and does not render it in `toString()`.

### TLS troubleshooting

A failed handshake surfaces as `StatusRuntimeException` with status `UNAVAILABLE` (description
`ssl exception` or `io exception`); the cause chain names the reason:

* **`PKIX path building failed` / `unable to find valid certification path to requested target`**:
  `grpcCert` is not the CA that issued the server certificate, the server does not send its
  intermediate certificates, or `grpcCert` is empty and the JVM trust store does not know the CA.
* **`No subject alternative names matching IP address ...` / `No name matching ... found`**: the
  host you connect to is not in the server certificate's SAN. Connect by a name in the SAN, add
  the SAN, or set `overrideAuthority(...)`.
* **`TLSV1_ALERT_CERTIFICATE_REQUIRED`** (or another alert) against a server that requires client
  certificates: no client certificate was presented, or one the server's CA did not issue. Set
  `grpcClientCert` / `grpcClientKey` to an identity that CA signed.
* **`IllegalArgumentException: GrpcChannels: could not create the channel to ...`** with the cause
  `No certificate data found`, `Input stream not contain valid certificates` or
  `Input stream does not contain valid private key`: a field holds a file path or other non-PEM
  text, or the key is encrypted or not PKCS#8. Pass `Files.readString(...)` of the PEM file.

## Regenerating the stubs

```bash
make build
```

That target runs the whole pipeline and is the only supported way to regenerate:

1. `update_submodules` — `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
1. `checkout_defined_submodule_versions` — checks out the `ondewo-sip-api` and
   `ondewo-proto-compiler` revisions pinned at the top of the `Makefile`.
1. `build_compiler` — `cd ondewo-proto-compiler/java && sh build.sh`, which builds the
   `ondewo-java-proto-compiler:latest` image. The image tag is the only contract; any locally
   built image with that tag is used.
1. `generate_ondewo_protos` — the single `docker run` below.
1. `check_build` — asserts that every `.proto` produced java code.
1. `package` — `mvn -DskipTests package` against the freshly rendered `pom.xml`.

The generation step is exactly the contract documented in
`ondewo-proto-compiler/java/example/run-compile.sh`:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/ondewo-sip-api:/input-volume/ondewo-sip-api \
  -v $(pwd)/LICENSE:/input-volume/LICENSE \
  -v $(pwd):/output-volume \
  ondewo-java-proto-compiler \
  ondewo-sip-api ondewo com.ondewo ondewo-sip-client-java <version>
```

The positional arguments are `<relative_protos_dir> <target_subdir> <group_id> <artifact_id>
<version>`; the last three are the java target's equivalent of the node targets' library name,
because java has nothing in the input volume to read the library identity from.

Things worth knowing about that invocation:

* **No `-it`.** It breaks every non-interactive caller with `cannot attach stdin to a
  TTY-enabled container because stdin is not a terminal`. Keep `-it` only for the debug form:
  `docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash -v ... ondewo-java-proto-compiler`.
* **Only the api submodule is mounted as input**, not the whole repository. A `pom.xml` found at
  the input-volume root *wins* over the rendered template, so mounting the repository root would
  freeze the library version at whatever the previously generated file says.
* **The output volume is the repository root**, which is precisely the maven project the image
  emits. Expect a loud `WARNING: ... pom.xml ... is about to be OVERWRITTEN` on every run — that
  is the descriptor being re-rendered from `ONDEWO_SIP_VERSION`, and is intended.
* **The container runs as root** (it writes into the root-owned `/image-data` inside the image),
  so the output is root-owned. `make fix_ownership` runs right after and `chown`s it back, which
  may prompt for `sudo`.
* **Generation needs no network** once the image exists: the maven build inside the container
  runs offline against a repository pre-warmed at image-build time.

### Hand-written code beside the stubs

The image deletes only the *leaf* java packages it regenerates, so hand-written classes survive
a regeneration as long as they live in their own package (for example
`src/main/java/com/ondewo/sip/auth/`). Two rules follow from the pipeline:

* Never put a hand-written class in a package that holds generated stubs — it is deleted on the
  next run.
* Hand-written code must compile against the generated `pom.xml`, i.e. against gRPC, protobuf
  and the JDK only (`java.net.http` covers HTTP/token work). Extra dependencies require a
  hand-maintained `pom.xml` mounted at the input-volume root, and every version it names must be
  one that the compiler image pre-warmed, because the packaging step runs `mvn --offline`.

## Testing

```bash
make test          # check_build + mvn verify (suite + coverage gate)
mvn -B verify      # the same without the submodule-dependent check_build
```

The JUnit 5 suite under `src/test/java` exercises the **committed** stubs — it never builds the
compiler image and never runs protoc:

| Test class | What it proves |
| --- | --- |
| `com.ondewo.sip.stubs.GeneratedMessagesTest` | messages nested in the outer class `ondewo.sip.SipOuterClass` survive a serialize/parse round trip — scalars, a map field, a `google.protobuf.Timestamp` and a repeated message — every enum starts at its declared zero value, and the proto package in the descriptor is untouched by the `java_package` rewrite. `sip.proto` declares no `optional` scalar, so there is no explicit-presence case to assert |
| `com.ondewo.sip.stubs.GeneratedServicesTest` | the generated `SipGrpc` class (found on the compiled classpath, not listed by hand) exposes a usable `ServiceDescriptor`, a unary `SipStartSession` call runs end to end over the in-process transport and the real generated marshallers, and all three stub flavours build against a plain target channel. `sip.proto` declares no streaming rpc, so there is no streaming method type to assert |
| `com.ondewo.sip.auth.BearerTokenTest` | the hand-written `BearerToken` — validation, header shape, stub immutability |
| `com.ondewo.sip.channel.ClientConfigTest` | `ClientConfig` validation (host, port, both-or-neither client identity, no identity on plaintext), IPv6 target bracketing, and that neither an error message nor `toString()` renders a PEM or the key |
| `com.ondewo.sip.channel.GrpcChannelsTest` | real TLS handshakes against a Netty server on a loopback socket with a PKI generated at test time: TLS with a custom CA, mutual TLS (the server sees the client certificate), CRLF PEMs, IPv6 `[::1]`, empty identity = plain TLS; refused handshakes (no client certificate, client from an unrelated CA, wrong CA, JVM trust store against a test CA) end in `UNAVAILABLE`; plaintext logs a warning naming `host:port`; non-PEM material is refused without being echoed |
| `com.ondewo.sip.release.ReleaseNotesTest` | every `RELEASE.md` heading uses the spelling `CURRENT_RELEASE_NOTES` slices, every section ends at its `*****` separator, and the current version has non-empty notes - so a GitHub release is never published without a body |

Coverage is measured with **JaCoCo over the hand-written sources only**
(`com/ondewo/sip/auth/**` and `com/ondewo/sip/channel/**`). Generated stubs are machine output and are excluded from the metric,
but they are exercised by the two test classes above. The gate is bound to `verify` and fails the
build below **100 %** instruction, branch and method coverage; the HTML report lands in
`target/site/jacoco/`.

CI runs the whole thing on `ubuntu-latest` for JDK 11 and JDK 21 on every push and pull request
— see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. No step is conditional: a missing or truncated client turns the
run red instead of skipping.

## Release

Versions are defined once, in the `Makefile`: `ONDEWO_SIP_VERSION` must match the
`ondewo-sip-api` release in major and minor version, and is written into the generated `pom.xml` by
the next `make build`.

1. Bump `ONDEWO_SIP_VERSION` and the submodule pins in the `Makefile`.
1. Add the release entry at the top of `RELEASE.md`.
1. `make ondewo_release` — checks that the branch/tag/pom version are consistent (`spc`), fetches
   the GitHub and Maven Central credentials from the `ondewo-devops-accounts` repository,
   rebuilds everything, commits, creates the release branch and tag, publishes the GitHub
   release with the built jars attached, and uploads the signed deployment to Maven Central.

`make release` does the same with credentials taken from the environment
(`GITHUB_GH_TOKEN=... MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME=... make release`).

## Publishing to Maven Central

The artifact is published to Maven Central through the
[Sonatype Central Portal](https://central.sonatype.com). Every deployment is uploaded with
`autoPublish=false`: it is validated and then **waits in the Portal for a human to press
Publish**. That last step is deliberate, because a published version can never be replaced or
withdrawn.

### What is checked, and when

| When | What |
| --- | --- |
| Every push (CI) | `make dry_run_maven_central` — builds with the `release` profile, signs everything with a throwaway key, verifies the signatures, and re-runs the whole build with maven offline. Needs no credential. |
| Before an upload | `make check_central_pom` — the pom carries every field the Portal validates; `make check_maven_central_credentials` — no credential is still a placeholder. |
| The upload | `make push_to_maven_central_via_docker` (from a maintainer's machine, credentials from `ondewo-devops-accounts`) **or** `.github/workflows/release.yml` (triggered by the version tag, credentials from the repository's Actions secrets). They are alternatives; use one per release. |

### Credentials

Four secrets, stored **twice**: in `ondewo-devops-accounts/account_maven_central.env` for the
`make` route and as GitHub Actions secrets of this repository for the workflow route. The names
are identical in both places, and the `Makefile` declares them with `ENTER_HERE_YOUR_...`
placeholders so an unconfigured machine fails loudly instead of publishing.

| Name | What it is | How to obtain it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME` | Username half of a Central Portal **user token** — not the portal login. | [central.sonatype.com/account](https://central.sonatype.com/account) → *Generate User Token*. |
| `MAVEN_CENTRAL_PASSWORD` | Password half of that same user token. | Same dialog; it is shown once. |
| `MAVEN_GPG_KEY_B64` | The PGP **secret** key that signs the artifacts, base64 on a single line. | `gpg --armor --export-secret-keys <fingerprint> \| base64 -w0` |
| `MAVEN_GPG_PASSPHRASE` | Passphrase of that key. | Chosen when the key is created. |

`MAVEN_GPG_KEY_B64` is base64-encoded because both carriers are strictly one line per variable:
an `account_*.env` line, and the `make release VAR=...` hand-off in `run_release_with_devops`. It
is decoded into `MAVEN_GPG_KEY` in the process environment immediately before maven starts and
is never written to disk. The `bc` signer of `maven-gpg-plugin` reads it from there, so no
keyring, `gpg` binary or `gpg-agent` has to exist in the runner or the publishing container.

### One-time setup (a human, once)

1. **Own the namespace.** `com.ondewo` is the reverse of `ondewo.com`, so it is ONDEWO's to
   claim. Add the namespace at
   [central.sonatype.com/publishing/namespaces](https://central.sonatype.com/publishing/namespaces)
   and complete the DNS proof: the Portal hands out a verification code that has to appear as a
   `TXT` record on `ondewo.com`. Until the namespace shows *Verified*, every upload is rejected.
2. **Create the signing key** (4096-bit RSA, with a passphrase), publish its public half to a
   keyserver Central checks, and note its fingerprint:

   ```bash
   gpg --full-generate-key
   gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
   gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys <fingerprint>
   ```

   Central verifies the signature against the public key, so a key that is not on a keyserver
   fails validation even though the upload itself succeeded.
3. **Generate the user token** and store all four values in
   `ondewo-devops-accounts/account_maven_central.env`.
4. **Add the same four values** as repository secrets under
   *Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions*.
