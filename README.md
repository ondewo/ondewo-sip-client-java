  <h1>
  ONDEWO SIP Client Java Library
  </h1>
</div>

This library gives a Java application a typed, ready-to-use gRPC client for the ONDEWO
SIP (SIP Telephony) server.

It contains no hand-written protocol code. The service and message classes are generated from
the protobuf definitions in the [ondewo-sip-api](https://github.com/ondewo/ondewo-sip-api) repository
(vendored here as a git submodule) by the
[ONDEWO proto compiler](https://github.com/ondewo/ondewo-proto-compiler) (vendored as a second
submodule), which also renders the `pom.xml` and packages the jar. Everything under
`src/main/java` and the `pom.xml` are therefore build output that happens to be committed, so
the repository can be consumed and opened in an IDE without Docker.

## Requirements

| For | You need |
| --- | --- |
| Using the library | JDK 11 or newer (the jar is compiled with `maven.compiler.release=11`) |
| Building the jar locally | JDK 11+ and Maven 3.6+ |
| Regenerating the stubs | Docker, GNU Make, git |

## Installation

### Maven Central

The published coordinates are `com.ondewo:ondewo-sip-client-java`. Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.ondewo</groupId>
  <artifactId>ondewo-sip-client-java</artifactId>
  <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:

```groovy
dependencies { implementation 'com.ondewo:ondewo-sip-client-java:VERSION' }
```

No `<repositories>` block is needed - Maven Central is the default repository of both build
tools. Every published version ships the binary jar, a sources jar and a javadoc jar, each with
a detached PGP signature, so an IDE resolves sources and docs automatically.

> Which versions are on Maven Central is listed at
> [search.maven.org](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.ondewo/ondewo-sip-client-java).
> Versions released before the namespace was verified are only available through the two
> fallbacks below.

### JitPack

[JitPack](https://jitpack.io) builds this repository straight from its git tag, so it works for
every tag, including ones that predate the Maven Central release:

```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>jitpack.io</id>
    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.ondewo</groupId>
  <artifactId>ondewo-sip-client-java</artifactId>
  <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:

```groovy
repositories { maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } }
dependencies { implementation 'com.github.ondewo:ondewo-sip-client-java:VERSION' }
```

### Jar from the GitHub release

Every [release](https://github.com/ondewo/ondewo-sip-client-java/releases) carries the built
`ondewo-sip-client-java-<version>.jar` and its sources jar as assets. Install one into
your local repository with the `pom.xml` of the matching tag, so the transitive gRPC and
protobuf dependencies come along:

```bash
mvn install:install-file \
  -Dfile=ondewo-sip-client-java-<version>.jar \
  -DpomFile=pom.xml
```

It is then available as:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.ondewo</groupId>
  <artifactId>ondewo-sip-client-java</artifactId>
  <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

### From source

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ondewo/ondewo-sip-client-java.git
cd ondewo-sip-client-java
make package        # compiles the committed stubs into target/*.jar
```

## Usage

The generated classes keep the java package protoc derives from the proto package, so the
service stubs of this client live in `ondewo.sip`. Each proto service `Foo` becomes a
`FooGrpc` class with a blocking, a future and an async stub; list what is available with:

```bash
ls src/main/java/ondewo/sip/*Grpc.java
```

A minimal call, with the bearer token ONDEWO servers expect attached to every request:

```java
import com.ondewo.sip.auth.BearerToken;
import io.grpc.ManagedChannel;
import io.grpc.ManagedChannelBuilder;
import ondewo.sip.SipGrpc;

String host = System.getenv("ONDEWO_HOST");
int port = Integer.parseInt(System.getenv("ONDEWO_PORT"));
String accessToken = System.getenv("ONDEWO_TOKEN");

ManagedChannel channel = ManagedChannelBuilder
    .forAddress(host, port)
    .useTransportSecurity()   // .usePlaintext() for a local, unencrypted server
    .build();

SipGrpc.SipBlockingStub stub = new BearerToken(accessToken)
    .attachTo(SipGrpc.newBlockingStub(channel));

// ... issue requests through `stub`, then shut the channel down:
channel.shutdownNow();
```

`BearerToken` is the one hand-written class of this client (see
[Hand-written code beside the stubs](#hand-written-code-beside-the-stubs)); it wraps the
`authorization: Bearer <token>` header every ONDEWO server expects. Attaching the header by hand
with `MetadataUtils.newAttachHeadersInterceptor(...)` works just as well.

Note that the protos do not set `java_multiple_files`, so every message is nested inside
the outer class protoc names after the proto file: `ondewo/sip/sip.proto` →
`ondewo.sip.SipOuterClass` (protoc appends `OuterClass` because the file also declares a
service named `Sip`). No `com.ondewo.sip` classes are generated, which is why the
hand-written `BearerToken` can live there without ever colliding with the generator.

## Repository structure

```

## Regenerating the stubs

```bash
make build
```

That target runs the whole pipeline and is the only supported way to regenerate:

1. `update_submodules` — `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
1. `checkout_defined_submodule_versions` — checks out the `ondewo-sip-api` and
   `ondewo-proto-compiler` revisions pinned at the top of the `Makefile`.
1. `build_compiler` — `cd ondewo-proto-compiler/java && sh build.sh`, which builds the
   `ondewo-java-proto-compiler:latest` image. The image tag is the only contract; any locally
   built image with that tag is used.
1. `generate_ondewo_protos` — the single `docker run` below.
1. `check_build` — asserts that every `.proto` produced java code.
1. `package` — `mvn -DskipTests package` against the freshly rendered `pom.xml`.

The generation step is exactly the contract documented in
`ondewo-proto-compiler/java/example/run-compile.sh`:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/ondewo-sip-api:/input-volume/ondewo-sip-api \
  -v $(pwd)/LICENSE:/input-volume/LICENSE \
  -v $(pwd):/output-volume \
  ondewo-java-proto-compiler \
  ondewo-sip-api ondewo com.ondewo ondewo-sip-client-java <version>
```

The positional arguments are `<relative_protos_dir> <target_subdir> <group_id> <artifact_id>
<version>`; the last three are the java target's equivalent of the node targets' library name,
because java has nothing in the input volume to read the library identity from.

Things worth knowing about that invocation:

* **No `-it`.** It breaks every non-interactive caller with `cannot attach stdin to a
  TTY-enabled container because stdin is not a terminal`. Keep `-it` only for the debug form:
  `docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash -v ... ondewo-java-proto-compiler`.
* **Only the api submodule is mounted as input**, not the whole repository. A `pom.xml` found at
  the input-volume root *wins* over the rendered template, so mounting the repository root would
  freeze the library version at whatever the previously generated file says.
* **The output volume is the repository root**, which is precisely the maven project the image
  emits. Expect a loud `WARNING: ... pom.xml ... is about to be OVERWRITTEN` on every run — that
  is the descriptor being re-rendered from `ONDEWO_SIP_VERSION`, and is intended.
* **The container runs as root** (it writes into the root-owned `/image-data` inside the image),
  so the output is root-owned. `make fix_ownership` runs right after and `chown`s it back, which
  may prompt for `sudo`.
* **Generation needs no network** once the image exists: the maven build inside the container
  runs offline against a repository pre-warmed at image-build time.

### Hand-written code beside the stubs

The image deletes only the *leaf* java packages it regenerates, so hand-written classes survive
a regeneration as long as they live in their own package (for example
`src/main/java/com/ondewo/sip/auth/`). Two rules follow from the pipeline:

* Never put a hand-written class in a package that holds generated stubs — it is deleted on the
  next run.
* Hand-written code must compile against the generated `pom.xml`, i.e. against gRPC, protobuf
  and the JDK only (`java.net.http` covers HTTP/token work). Extra dependencies require a
  hand-maintained `pom.xml` mounted at the input-volume root, and every version it names must be
  one that the compiler image pre-warmed, because the packaging step runs `mvn --offline`.

## Testing

```bash
make test          # check_build + mvn verify (suite + coverage gate)
mvn -B verify      # the same without the submodule-dependent check_build
```

The JUnit 5 suite under `src/test/java` exercises the **committed** stubs — it never builds the
compiler image and never runs protoc:

| Test class | What it proves |
| --- | --- |
| `com.ondewo.sip.stubs.GeneratedMessagesTest` | messages nested in the outer class `ondewo.sip.SipOuterClass` survive a serialize/parse round trip — scalars, a map field, a `google.protobuf.Timestamp` and a repeated message — every enum starts at its declared zero value, and the proto package in the descriptor is untouched by the `java_package` rewrite. `sip.proto` declares no `optional` scalar, so there is no explicit-presence case to assert |
| `com.ondewo.sip.stubs.GeneratedServicesTest` | the generated `SipGrpc` class (found on the compiled classpath, not listed by hand) exposes a usable `ServiceDescriptor`, a unary `SipStartSession` call runs end to end over the in-process transport and the real generated marshallers, and all three stub flavours build against a plain target channel. `sip.proto` declares no streaming rpc, so there is no streaming method type to assert |
| `com.ondewo.sip.auth.BearerTokenTest` | the hand-written `BearerToken` — validation, header shape, stub immutability |

Coverage is measured with **JaCoCo over the hand-written sources only**
(`com/ondewo/sip/auth/**`). Generated stubs are machine output and are excluded from the metric,
but they are exercised by the two test classes above. The gate is bound to `verify` and fails the
build below **100 %** instruction, branch and method coverage; the HTML report lands in
`target/site/jacoco/`.

CI runs the whole thing on `ubuntu-latest` for JDK 11 and JDK 21 on every push and pull request
— see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. No step is conditional: a missing or truncated client turns the
run red instead of skipping.

## Release

Versions are defined once, in the `Makefile`: `ONDEWO_SIP_VERSION` must match the
`ondewo-sip-api` release in major and minor version, and is written into the generated `pom.xml` by
the next `make build`.

1. Bump `ONDEWO_SIP_VERSION` and the submodule pins in the `Makefile`.
1. Add the release entry at the top of `RELEASE.md`.
1. `make ondewo_release` — checks that the branch/tag/pom version are consistent (`spc`), fetches
   the GitHub and Maven Central credentials from the `ondewo-devops-accounts` repository,
   rebuilds everything, commits, creates the release branch and tag, publishes the GitHub
   release with the built jars attached, and uploads the signed deployment to Maven Central.

`make release` does the same with credentials taken from the environment
(`GITHUB_GH_TOKEN=... MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME=... make release`).

## Publishing to Maven Central

The artifact is published to Maven Central through the
[Sonatype Central Portal](https://central.sonatype.com). Every deployment is uploaded with
`autoPublish=false`: it is validated and then **waits in the Portal for a human to press
Publish**. That last step is deliberate, because a published version can never be replaced or
withdrawn.

### What is checked, and when

| When | What |
| --- | --- |
| Every push (CI) | `make dry_run_maven_central` — builds with the `release` profile, signs everything with a throwaway key, verifies the signatures, and re-runs the whole build with maven offline. Needs no credential. |
| Before an upload | `make check_central_pom` — the pom carries every field the Portal validates; `make check_maven_central_credentials` — no credential is still a placeholder. |
| The upload | `make push_to_maven_central_via_docker` (from a maintainer's machine, credentials from `ondewo-devops-accounts`) **or** `.github/workflows/release.yml` (triggered by the version tag, credentials from the repository's Actions secrets). They are alternatives; use one per release. |

### Credentials

Four secrets, stored **twice**: in `ondewo-devops-accounts/account_maven_central.env` for the
`make` route and as GitHub Actions secrets of this repository for the workflow route. The names
are identical in both places, and the `Makefile` declares them with `ENTER_HERE_YOUR_...`
placeholders so an unconfigured machine fails loudly instead of publishing.

| Name | What it is | How to obtain it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME` | Username half of a Central Portal **user token** — not the portal login. | [central.sonatype.com/account](https://central.sonatype.com/account) → *Generate User Token*. |
| `MAVEN_CENTRAL_PASSWORD` | Password half of that same user token. | Same dialog; it is shown once. |
| `MAVEN_GPG_KEY_B64` | The PGP **secret** key that signs the artifacts, base64 on a single line. | `gpg --armor --export-secret-keys <fingerprint> \| base64 -w0` |
| `MAVEN_GPG_PASSPHRASE` | Passphrase of that key. | Chosen when the key is created. |

`MAVEN_GPG_KEY_B64` is base64-encoded because both carriers are strictly one line per variable:
an `account_*.env` line, and the `make release VAR=...` hand-off in `run_release_with_devops`. It
is decoded into `MAVEN_GPG_KEY` in the process environment immediately before maven starts and
is never written to disk. The `bc` signer of `maven-gpg-plugin` reads it from there, so no
keyring, `gpg` binary or `gpg-agent` has to exist in the runner or the publishing container.

### One-time setup (a human, once)

1. **Own the namespace.** `com.ondewo` is the reverse of `ondewo.com`, so it is ONDEWO's to
   claim. Add the namespace at
   [central.sonatype.com/publishing/namespaces](https://central.sonatype.com/publishing/namespaces)
   and complete the DNS proof: the Portal hands out a verification code that has to appear as a
   `TXT` record on `ondewo.com`. Until the namespace shows *Verified*, every upload is rejected.
2. **Create the signing key** (4096-bit RSA, with a passphrase), publish its public half to a
   keyserver Central checks, and note its fingerprint:

   ```bash
   gpg --full-generate-key
   gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
   gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys <fingerprint>
   ```

   Central verifies the signature against the public key, so a key that is not on a keyserver
   fails validation even though the upload itself succeeded.
3. **Generate the user token** and store all four values in
   `ondewo-devops-accounts/account_maven_central.env`.
4. **Add the same four values** as repository secrets under
   *Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions*.
